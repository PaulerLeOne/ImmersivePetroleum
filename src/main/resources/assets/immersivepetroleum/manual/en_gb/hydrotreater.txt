Smell of Fireworks
<&hydrotreater0>The Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) is a multiblock machine that seperates Sulphur from Sulphurized Diesel by using Hydrogen and Oxygen gained from the Electrolysis of Water.

It uses <config;i;hydrotreater_operationcost> Flux per operation<np>
It is built as shown and formed by using the Engineering's Hammer on the Heavy Engineering Block in the Centre

Applying a redstone signal to the control panel will halt the machine's process, this behaviour can be inverted by use of the Screwdriver.<np>

Sulphurized Diesel is pumped into the port at the front.
Water is pumped into the port at the top.
Sulphur is dumped out the left side.
Diesel is pumped out of the top port on the left side.
